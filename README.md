# Automatic-Modulation-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
This project is made by me during my Dissertation, where i designed an CNN model which automatically classify modulated signal using Convolutional Neural Networks and USRP Hardware. 

This project implements an **SDR-based Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC)** system using **USRP B210** hardware and **MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox**.  
The system classifies modulated signals (ASK, BPSK, QPSK, etc.) using a **CNN model** trained on both synthetic and over-the-air datasets.

##  Features
- Dual-USRP B210 setup for real-time TX/RX.
- CNN-based classifier trained in MATLAB.
- Compact UHF RFID reader antenna integrated for ASK testing.
- Achieved high accuracy in simulation and hardware-in-the-loop validation.

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Hardware**: USRP B210, UHF RFID Antenna
- **Software**: MATLAB, GNU Radio, Deep Learning Toolbox
- **Modulations**: ASK, BPSK, QPSK, QAM, etc.
