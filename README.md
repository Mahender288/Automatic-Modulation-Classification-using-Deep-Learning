# Automatic-Modulation-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
This project is made by me during my Masters Dissertation, where i designed an CNN model which automatically classify modulated signal using Convolutional Neural Networks and USRP Hardware. 

This project implements an **SDR-based Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC)** system using **USRP B210** hardware and **MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox**.  
The system classifies modulated signals (ASK, BPSK, QPSK, etc.) using a **CNN model** trained on both synthetic and over-the-air datasets.

##  Features
- Dual-USRP B210 setup for real-time TX/RX.
- CNN-based classifier trained in MATLAB.
- Compact UHF RFID reader antenna integrated for ASK testing.
- Achieved high accuracy in simulation and hardware-in-the-loop validation.

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Hardware**: USRP B210, UHF RFID Antenna
- **Software**: MATLAB, GNU Radio, Deep Learning Toolbox
- **Modulations**: ASK, BPSK, QPSK, QAM, etc.

## Deep Learning Approach
**Method Used**

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture for Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC). 
CNNs are highly effective in recognizing spatial and temporal patterns in IQ signal data, making them suitable for modulation recognition tasks.

Input Representation: IQ samples (real and imaginary parts of received signals) were reshaped into 2D matrices.

**Architecture**:

Convolutional layers extract low-level modulation features such as amplitude/phase variations.

Pooling layers reduce dimensionality while preserving key features.

Fully connected layers perform final classification across modulation types (ASK, BPSK, QPSK, QAM, etc.).

Output: Softmax layer producing class probabilities for each modulation scheme.

**Implementation**

- Data Generation:

Synthetic dataset generated in MATLAB using impaired signals (AWGN, fading, frequency offsets).

Over-the-air dataset captured using dual-USRP B210 setup and UHF RFID antenna.

- Training:

MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox used to train CNN.

Training performed with mini-batch gradient descent and data augmentation for robustness.

- Testing:

Trained model validated both in simulation and in real-time SDR environment with USRP hardware.

**Impact of AI/ML in This Project**

- Automation: Traditional AMC requires handcrafted features (cyclostationary analysis, likelihood tests, etc.), but deep learning automatically learns optimal features from raw IQ data.

- Accuracy: CNN-based AMC achieves higher classification accuracy under noisy and fading conditions compared to classical methods.

- Scalability: The framework can be extended to classify more complex modulations or integrated into IoT/RFID communication systems.

- Real-Time Capability: By leveraging SDR hardware and CNN inference, the system demonstrates practical deployment feasibility in wireless communication and RFID environments.
